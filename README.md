# App
There is also an Android App available.

# Messenger
It includes a messenger/chatbox option.

# Installation

Not for immediate production yet, testing only. Because some URLS are hardcoded, it requires editing of a few files:
/resources/php/header.php (contains most configuration data.)

# MySQL

STRICT_TRANS_TABLES is not supported, and needs to be disabled for it to work

# Requirements:

Requires the latest PHP 8.3 en MySQL versions.
Does not run on XAMPP because it requires PHP 8.3.2.
